# Machine Learning Robot Competition
## Competition Overview
The scope of this project is to develop a software agent that would control a
robot and navigate across a simulated world while reporting license plates and
their location. While navigating the agent should be able to avoid obstacles such
as other vehicles and pedestrians and follow standard traffic rules. The simulation
was built in Gazebo and the agent takes live image feed from the in-simulation
camera mounted on top of the robot. The agent must interact with the world in
ROS, while it is scripted using python 2.7. The competition itself consists of a four
minutes trial where the agent must individually and autonomously run along the
track and report as many license plate possible
